A fun movie based scenario game built in C++ with mini games in between!

Each stage of the game is based on a movie : Harry Potter, Kill Bill, Pokemon, How to Train Your Dragon

Whether or not you will move on to the next stage depends on the choices you make in a given scenario.
Based on what you choose, you can kill your character, win wars, save friends, etc.

After each stage is a mini game which you must win to move on to the next round.

The final version of the code is provided in the 'final' folder.
